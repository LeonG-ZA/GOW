		/* We need your assistance with a matter that is most grave. To the north,
		 * from within the Tomb of Kings, the Arisen are emerging each night to
		 * attack the Holy City.
		 * 
		 * Shortly after we unsealed the entrance to the Abyss, found in the depths
		 * of the Tomb, strange happenings began to occur. At first, there were only 
		 * a few reports of strange noises coming from the Tomb of Kings late at
		 * night. Investigating the Tomb during the daytime uncovered nothing unusual,
		 * so we sent someone to seek out the source of these noises one night. When
		 * morning came and he had not returned, we knew something was amiss.
		 * 
		 * We sent word to the Royal City asking for help, but the following night,
		 * unspeakable evil erupted from the entrance to the Tomb! A defense of the
		 * city was quickly marshaled, but the Arisen proved to be quite powerful.
		 * Unfortunately, they are also persistent, as every night since then, this
		 * city, the original birthplace of our people, has faced wave after wave of
		 * Arisen. We know not the cause of the attacks, nor the source, as
		 * investigations by daylight yield little. We have been hard pressed just to
		 * defend the Elders here, much less push the Arisen back into the Tomb.
		 * 
		 * We could use your help in this! Either help defend the Holy City at night,
		 * or enter the Tomb of Kings itself and seek out the Arisen at their source.
		 * It is your choice to make, as you know your own abilities best. If you
		 * decide to enter the Tomb of Kings, you'll need to speak the words "ord"
		 * and "an-ord" to pass the Serpent's Breath.<br><br>Succeed in this task,
		 * and I shall reward you well. */

		 * 
		 * All who wish to enter must seek out the Shrine of Singularity to the
		 * North for further meditation. Only those found to be on the Sacred
		 * Quest will be allowed to enter the Abyss. I would advise that you seek
		 * out some of the ancient texts in the Holy City Museum, which you can find
		 * to the south, so that you might focus better while meditating at the
		 * Shrine. As promised, here is your reward. */
